🔍 *Kernel events don’t lie — they reveal everything happening under the hood.*
Securing Kubernetes nodes isn't just about setting policies — it’s about **visibility** into real-time activity. That's where **eBPF + DaemonSets** shine.

𝗪𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗱𝗼? 🛡️
→ Captures kernel events like `do_execve`, `load_module`, and `security_sb_mount`.

→ Monitors suspicious container behavior (privileged launches, root processes, filesystem access)

→ Logs real-time activity from `trace_pipe` and exports metrics via Prometheus

→ Runs periodic system audits every 5 minutes for baseline anomaly detection

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗱𝗼𝗲𝘀 𝗶𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗿? 📉
→ Catch **process injections**, **privilege escalations**, and **module loads** before they spread

→ Identify **unauthorized file access** and **unexpected network listeners**

→ Get **real-time security observability** without heavy agents or commercial overhead
