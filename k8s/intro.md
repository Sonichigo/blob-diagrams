Last year, Kubernetes officially dropped support for Docker as a container runtime in **v1.27**. If you're still trying to wrap your head around what that meansâ€”or you're just getting started with Kubernetesâ€”this one's for you.

With mastering basics of Kubernetes no longer optional - setting up a cluster, deploying applications, and managing rollbacks? That still feels daunting to many.

Here's what you need to know:

â†’ Kubernetes now uses containerd (a Docker shim) instead of Docker runtimeâ€”leaner, faster, and purpose-built for orchestration.

â†’ You can launch a local cluster in minutes using tools like Colima + Minikube.

â†’ Deploy real workloads like NGINX, expose them via NodePort services, and test the live URLsâ€”all from your terminal.

â†’ Simulate failure (yes, intentionally), and learn how to roll back deployments gracefully using native kubectl commands.

â†’ **The best part?** Youâ€™ll observe how Kubernetes manages health, state, and traffic, giving you hands-on insight into its declarative power.

This tutorial is your **Zeroâ†’One** Kubernetes lab environment.
